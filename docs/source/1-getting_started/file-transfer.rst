File Transfer
======================================================

In order to transfer files to and from the supercomputer (OzSTAR), a ssh-based file transfer utility is required. There are a variety of Options that you can use.

+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Operating System | Terminal                                                                                                                                                                  |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Mac              | `“scp” (secure copy) command <http://www.computerhope.com/unix/scp.htm>`_ can be used via the terminal or use `Cyberduck <https://cyberduck.io/>`_ as a GUI alternative   |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Linux            | `“scp” (secure copy) command _` can be used via the terminal                                                                                                              |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Windows          | The recommended software is `WinSCP <http://winscp.net/eng/index.php>`_                                                                                                   |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

As an alternative option, you can use a SFTP Client (e.g `FileZilla <https://filezilla-project.org/>`_ Client – more details about using the SFTP mode in FileZilla can be found on https://it.unh.edu/sftp/filezilla.html)


Copying a file or directory via SSH
---------------------------------------

The simplest way to copy a file to or from the supercomputer is to use the ``scp`` command.

.. note::

    In the following examples, we assume an ``ozstar`` alias set to ``[your-username]@ozstar.swin.edu.au``.

**Copying a local file to the OzSTAR supercomputer**::

    scp ./file.txt ozstar:destination/path/

You can also copy a file from the supercomputer to your local machine (e.g. **download**) as follows::

    scp ozstar:path/to/file.txt .

**Copy a directory and its content** is done by using the ``-r`` option::

    scp -r path/to/copy/ ozstar:destination/path/

The above command will initiate a connection from your local environment to OzSTAR directly.

Transferring a large number of small files
--------------------------------------------

Transferring lots of small files can take a long time with ``scp`` due to the overhead of copying each file individually. Instead, it is advised to package your files into a single ``tar`` file using the `tar <https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_22.html>`__ command to significantly reduce the transfer time. This is done by create a tar archive, copying it using ``scp``, and finally ``untar`` it to retrieve your individual files.

.. Transferring large files
    ----------------------------

    When transferring large files, it is often interesting to use the ``-C`` option of ``scp`` to first compress the file, send it, and then decompress it. Using it simply with

    ::

        scp -C ./large_file.txt ozstar:destination/path/

Transferring code
----------------------
The best way to transfer code from one computer to another is to host the code in a *source code repository* using a *versioning system* such as `git <https://www.git-scm.com>`__ or `mercurial <https://www.mercurial-scm.org>`__ and clone the repository from your local computer, or a cloud service (e.g. bitbucket, github, ...), to the supercomputer.

Resuming interrupted transfers
--------------------------------

If a transfer is interrupted, you might end up with part of the files being transferred. Rather than restarting the transfer from scratch, you should then use the rsync command. The `rsync <https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync>`__ command will compare the **source** and **destination** directories and only transfer what needs to be transferred (missing files, modified files, etc.)

::

    rsync -va ./source_dir ozstar:destination/path

.. warning::

    Make sure not to leave trailing slashes in your path names (e.g. ``destination/path`` rather than ``destination/path/``); else you will have a full copy of the directory inside the existing, partial, one. Use the ``-n`` (dry-run) option of ``rsync`` to check what will happen before you run the actual command.

.. tip::

    If one large file is left partially transferred, you can resume it using the ``--partial``.

Useful rsync options: 

``rsync -avPxHS --no-g --chmod=Dg+s /g2/lustre/some/dir/ /fred/ozXXX/some/other/dir/`` 


Synchronising with a local directory
--------------------------------------------
If you want to keep two directories (one on your local computer, and one on the supercomputer) in sync, you can do that with rsync using its ``--delete`` option. But that is only one-way so you need to really think in what direction you do it, and it does not scale beyond two synchronized directory trees.

Another potential option is to use `Unison <https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/>`__, a piece of software that can detect and handle conflicts (incompatible changes made to the same file in the two directories that must be kept in sync.)

Please note that the supercomputer is **NOT** a place to use as a backup for your laptop or workstation's holiday snaps and emails.
